## Developing

### Quick start

```sh
$ pnpm install
$ cd packages/<widget-you-wish-to-start-work-on>
$ pnpm start
```

### Prerequisites

-   `node` version 16 -- we recommend use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installing and managin node on you local env, but you can download and [install node from official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   `pnpm` veresion 7.3.0 or higher â€“ please visit [Installation](https://pnpm.io/installation) docs section to get instruction on how to install pnpm in your local env.

As we are using [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) in our dependencies, please make sure to [install the required dependencies](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for this library according to your OS.

### Developer flow

-   Mendix projects for each widget already comes with repo with folder called
    `packages/pluggableWidgets/<widgetName>/tests/testProject`.
-   Run `pnpm run pretest:e2e` to initialize Mendix project.
-   Run `pnpm run build` on a desired widget folder. For ex: `packages/pluggableWidgets/badge-web`. This will build and copy the mpk to
    each Mendix project's correct widget folder.
-   Open and run the project in `<widgetName>/tests/testProject` with Mendix Studio.
-   If you want to override your local test project with a test project from GitHub, execute the `test:e2e` npm script with the following command: `pnpm run test:e2e -- --update-test-project`.

### Adding new test project to the repo

-   Go to `https://github.com/mendix/testProjects` and create an appropriate branch name from master
-   Add your **.mpr** files, commit and push (remember your branch name)
-   Go to `web-widgets` monorepo and in the `package.json` of the widget insert the branch name in the test project section.
